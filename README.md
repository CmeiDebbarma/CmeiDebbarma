### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **AI Product Engineer** and **M.Tech Data Engineering** candidate based in **India**. I don't just train models; I build resilient **Agentic Systems** that solve real-world problems. 

My work sits at the intersection of **Data Engineering** (scalable pipelines) and **AI Orchestration** (autonomous agents). I treat "Vibe Coding" as a serious discipline—finding the flow state where human creativity meets AI automation.

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Building autonomous multi-agent workflows that can code and reason.
* 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced orchestration patterns for LLMs in production.
* 💬 **Ask me about:** Python, LangChain, RAG, and Agentic Design Patterns.

###  Coding Philosophy ("The Vibe")
> *"The future isn't just about writing code; it's about curating the agents that write it. I practice 'Vibe Coding'—orchestrating AI to handle the heavy lifting while I focus on architecture and product vision."*
